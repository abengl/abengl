## 😊 Hi, I'm Alessandra Godoy

### :octocat: About Me

Passionate front-end developer focused on creating relevant and efficient software solutions. I have a Bachelor of Computer Science and strong skills in web development using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git. With experience working in agile environments and global teams, I am bilingual in Spanish and English (C2 level). I enjoy transforming ideas into effective technological solutions, and in my free time, I love carpentry, volunteering, and learning about different cultures and languages.
